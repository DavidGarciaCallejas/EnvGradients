## Interaction intensity across environmental gradients

The response function is defined in 

### EG_logistic_function_tests

and its parameterization is stored by running

### EG_survival_parameters
### EG_growth_parameters
### EG_join_species_parameters

then, generate a grid with

### EG_grid_structure

the main script, the model, is

### EG_model_1level

then you need to run

### EG_results_cleanup

and the results are analyzed, figures produced, with

### EG_statistical_analyses
### EG_gradient_figures
